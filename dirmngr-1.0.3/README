                -------------------------------------
                         Version 1.0.3


    Intro
    -----

    DirMngr is a server for managing and downloading certificate
    revocation lists (CRLs) for X.509 certificates and for downloading
    the certificates themselves. Dirmngr also handles OCSP requests as
    an alternative to CRLs. Dirmngr is either invoked internaly by
    gpgsm (from gnupg 1.9) or when running as a system daemon through
    the dirmngr-client tool.

    See the file COPYING for copyright and warranty information. See
    the file AUTHORS for contact addresses and code history.

    On W32 targets, the URL extension of OpenLDAP is included which is
    provided in src/ldap-url.c.  This file has a different copyright
    from the rest of the package.  Please see that file for more
    details.


    Installation
    ------------
    Please read the file INSTALL. Here is a quick summary:

    1) Unpack the tarball.  With GNU tar you can do it this way:
       "tar xjvf dirmngr-x.y.z.tar.bz2"

    2) "cd dirmngr-x.y.z"

    3) "./configure --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var"
       The two options make sure that the configuration data will
       not be search under /usr/local/etc and that variable data will
       be stored at a standard place too.

    4) "make"

    5) "make install"  (you probably need to become root first)

    6) You end up with a a dirmngr and dirmngr-client binary in
       /usr/local/bin.  Some other files are also installed for
       internal use.

    If you are using dirmngr as part of gnupg 2.0 you are done now.
    If you want to install it as a system daemon, please see the
    manual by running the command "info dirmngr"
